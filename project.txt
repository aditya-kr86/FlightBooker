Project Title: Flight Booking Simulator with Dynamic Pricing

Project Statement:
This project aims to develop a web-based Flight Booking Simulator that mimics real-world airline reservation systems, incorporating a dynamic pricing engine. The system allows users to search for flights, view fares that adjust based on time, seat availability, and simulated demand, and complete a multi-step booking process. This project focuses on the integration of a robust backend for managing dynamic fare calculations, seat inventory, and concurrent booking transactions. Through full-stack implementation, students will gain experience in API development, database design, pricing algorithms, and building reliable transactional systems.

Outcomes:
• A functional flight booking simulator with a responsive web interface
• Dynamic pricing algorithm based on simulated demand, seat inventory, and time to departure
• Backend API for flight search, pricing, booking, and cancellation
• Database design supporting transactional consistency and concurrent seat management
• Generation of booking confirmations (PNRs) and downloadable receipts
• Understanding of concurrency control and full-stack integration techniques

Modules to be Implemented:
1.Core Flight Search & Data Management
 • Design schema for flights, airlines, and airports
 • Build APIs for flight search with filtering and sorting
2.Dynamic Pricing Engine
 • Implement fare calculation based on dynamic conditions
 • Simulate seat demand and price shifts over time
3.Booking Workflow & Transaction Management
 • Develop booking process with concurrency control
 • Generate and store Passenger Name Records (PNR)
4.User Interface & API Integration
 • Create frontend UI for search and booking
 • Integrate all backend APIs and generate receipts

Milestone 1: Weeks 1–2
Module: Core Flight Search & Data Management
Objective: Set up the foundational data structures and implement static flight search APIs.
Tasks:
• Design and implement database schema for flights (origin, destination, times, price, seats)
• Set up a database (SQLite/PostgreSQL) and populate with simulated flight data
• Build REST APIs using Flask/FastAPI for:
 • Retrieving all flights
 • Searching by origin, destination, and date
• Implement input validation and sorting (by price or duration)
• Simulate external airline schedule APIs
Output:
• Populated flight database
• Functional flight search API with filtering and validation
• Simulated airline data feeds

Milestone 2: Weeks 3–4
Module: Dynamic Pricing Engine
Objective: Develop an algorithm to dynamically calculate prices and simulate real-world price shifts.
Tasks:
• Design pricing logic considering:
 • Remaining seat percentage
 • Time until departure
 • Simulated demand level
 • Base fare and pricing tiers
• Integrate pricing engine into flight search API
• Build background process to simulate demand/availability changes
• (Optional) Store fare history for tracking changes
Output:
• Dynamic pricing logic integrated into APIs
• Real-time fare adjustment based on multiple parameters
• Simulated demand-shift engine





Milestone 3: Weeks 5–6
Module: Booking Workflow & Transaction Management
Objective: Implement the booking process with concurrency safety and confirmation tracking.
Tasks:
• Design schema for bookings (flight ID, passenger info, seat, status, price)
• Develop multi-step booking flow:
 • Flight & seat selection
 • Passenger info
 • Simulated payment (success/fail)
• Generate unique PNR after successful booking
• Implement concurrency control using DB transactions or locks
• Build booking cancellation and history retrieval endpoints
Output:
• End-to-end booking process
• Concurrency-safe seat reservations
• PNR assignment and booking storage
• Functional cancellation and history retrieval

Milestone 4: Weeks 7–8
Module: User Interface & API Integration
Objective: Build a frontend and connect all backend functionality to deliver a cohesive user experience.
Tasks:
• Design UI using HTML/CSS/JS (or React if preferred)
• Integrate flight search and booking APIs into frontend
• Display real-time dynamic prices in search results
• Build UI for multi-step booking flow and PNR display
• Generate and download booking receipts (PDF or JSON)
• Final project polish and testing
Output:
• Fully functional frontend for booking simulator
• Seamless integration with backend services
• Booking confirmation receipts
• Usable, testable, and complete end-user experience
